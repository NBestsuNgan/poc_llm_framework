      "context 1: INTRODUCTION According to Choudhury (2007), Bhutan has been fairly well covered by ornithological surveys and the entire country forms a part of Eastern Himalaya Endemic Bird area (Stattersfield et al.,1998). As per United Nations Environment Program [UNEP] and Convention on Conservation of Migratory Species [CCMS](UNEP2009), 9856 bird species are recorded worldwide. Out of which 1855 species are migratory, 262 species are seabirds, 343 species are altitudinal migrants, 181 species are nomadic and 1593 species are migratory land and waterbirds. Over 800 species of birds are estimated to be found in Bhutan of which frequent numbers of winter visitors, such as migrant thrushes are found in addition to 450 species of resident birds (Sherpa2000). Forest is the most significant habitat for birds by supporting around 75% of all bird species while only 45% of all bird species have adapted to humans modified habitats (Birdlife International2008).Human activities such as farming, settlement, charcoal making, pole cutting and firewood collection have contributed in degradation which has extensively damaged the natural habitat of birds, affecting their variety and variability (Storch et al.2003).The threats to bird populations are immeasurable including habitat loss, fragmentation and severe anthropogenic pressures. Therefore the need to study the current composition and status of bird species as a basis for future monitoring and implementation of appropriate conservation measures (Choudhury 1991; Chandra andSingh2004).Birds constitute one of the common fauna of all habitat types, and because they are responsive to change, their diversity and abundance can reflect ecological trends in other biodiversity (Furness andGreenwood1993). MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Area Punatshangchhu (referred to as Sunkosh River in this paper) has a total length of about 320 kilometers from its source in Bhutan to its confluence point with Brahmaputra in India (Choden 2009). Therefore its river basin is one of the major river basins in Bhutan\n",

The country\\'s population census conducted by the PHCB in 2005 provides valuable insights into the demographic and housing landscape, underscoring its ecological significance despite its small size.\\n\\n**Bird Species Diversity:**\\nBhutan is renowned for its diverse bird populations, with species such as the Snow Goose (Cedrus chilinensis) and the Black-vented Weathcerbird (Parus tridactylus) being prominent. The country\\'s varied habitats, including alpine meadows, forests, wetlands, and mountains, support a wide range of bird species, each adapted to specific ecological niches.\\n\\n**Habitat Impact:**\\nThe altitudinal gradient in Bhutan supports distinct avian communities, with higher elevations hosting unique species like the Snow Goose. Urbanization and deforestation have posed challenges, affecting bird distribution patterns as noted by studies on beta diversity along environmental gradients.\\n\\n**Conservation Efforts:**\\nBhutan has implemented measures to protect its ecological integrity, including the establishment of protected areas that support diverse avian communities. International commitments, such as the Convention on Migratory Species, reflect Bhutan\\'s dedication to bird conservation and ecosystem preservation.\\n\\n**Ecological Methods:**\\nThe application of ecological census techniques, as referenced in Gibbons and Gregory\\'s work, has been instrumental in studying Bhutan\\'s bird populations, emphasizing the importance of accurate data collection for biodiversity assessment.\\n\\nIn summary, Bhutan\\'s biodiversity is a testament to its unique ecological landscape, supported by a variety of species adapted to different environments. Despite challenges from human activities, conservation efforts and international agreements ensure the preservation of this vital natural resource.'\n",
