      "context 1: INTRODUCTION According to Choudhury (2007), Bhutan has been fairly well covered by ornithological surveys and the entire country forms a part of Eastern Himalaya Endemic Bird area (Stattersfield et al.,1998). As per United Nations Environment Program [UNEP] and Convention on Conservation of Migratory Species [CCMS](UNEP2009), 9856 bird species are recorded worldwide. Out of which 1855 species are migratory, 262 species are seabirds, 343 species are altitudinal migrants, 181 species are nomadic and 1593 species are migratory land and waterbirds. Over 800 species of birds are estimated to be found in Bhutan of which frequent numbers of winter visitors, such as migrant thrushes are found in addition to 450 species of resident birds (Sherpa2000). Forest is the most significant habitat for birds by supporting around 75% of all bird species while only 45% of all bird species have adapted to humans modified habitats (Birdlife International2008).Human activities such as farming, settlement, charcoal making, pole cutting and firewood collection have contributed in degradation which has extensively damaged the natural habitat of birds, affecting their variety and variability (Storch et al.2003).The threats to bird populations are immeasurable including habitat loss, fragmentation and severe anthropogenic pressures. Therefore the need to study the current composition and status of bird species as a basis for future monitoring and implementation of appropriate conservation measures (Choudhury 1991; Chandra andSingh2004).Birds constitute one of the common fauna of all habitat types, and because they are responsive to change, their diversity and abundance can reflect ecological trends in other biodiversity (Furness andGreenwood1993). MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Area Punatshangchhu (referred to as Sunkosh River in this paper) has a total length of about 320 kilometers from its source in Bhutan to its confluence point with Brahmaputra in India (Choden 2009). Therefore its river basin is one of the major river basins in Bhutan\n",

      "Alright, so I've got this table here with two columns: \"age\" and \"cust_age\". The values under \"age\" are 48, 49, 36, 46, 35, and 37. Under \"cust_age\", the numbers are 10, 12, 11, 5, 8, and 5 respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, I notice that both columns have numerical values, but they don't seem to be directly related in an obvious way at first glance. The \"age\" column has higher numbers compared to the \"cust_age\" column for most entries except one where cust_age is also high (12). So maybe there's a pattern or relationship between them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if \"cust_age\" represents something like customer age, but that doesn't make much sense because typically, a customer's age would be similar to their own age. Maybe it's an error in the data entry? Or perhaps it's a different metric altogether, like the age of a product or another related attribute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at each pair:\n",
      "\n",
      "- 48 vs. 10: A significant difference here.\n",
      "- 49 vs. 12: Also quite a jump from the first one.\n",
      "- 36 vs. 11: Lower than expected.\n",
      "- 46 vs. 5: Huge discrepancy.\n",
      "- 35 vs. 8: Not as extreme but still noticeable.\n",
      "- 37 vs. 5: Another big drop.\n",
      "\n",
      "This makes me think that \"cust_age\" might not be directly related to the actual age in \"age\". It could be a different variable altogether, like the customer's account age or something else entirely. Alternatively, there might be some calculation involved, but without more context, it's hard to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another possibility is that \"cust_age\" represents the number of years since the customer joined or was acquired, which would mean subtracting from a current year value. For example, if today's date is 2023 and the customer joined in 2018 at age 46, then cust_age could be 5 (2023 - 2018). But that seems like an unusual use of the term \"age\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe \"cust_age\" is a placeholder or has been mistakenly labeled. Perhaps it's supposed to represent something else entirely, and there's confusion in the data naming.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, based on the given information, the main difference between the two columns appears to be that they don't have a clear numerical relationship, and \"cust_age\" seems to be an unrelated metric or possibly an error.\n",
