      "context 1: INTRODUCTION According to Choudhury (2007), Bhutan has been fairly well covered by ornithological surveys and the entire country forms a part of Eastern Himalaya Endemic Bird area (Stattersfield et al.,1998). As per United Nations Environment Program [UNEP] and Convention on Conservation of Migratory Species [CCMS](UNEP2009), 9856 bird species are recorded worldwide. Out of which 1855 species are migratory, 262 species are seabirds, 343 species are altitudinal migrants, 181 species are nomadic and 1593 species are migratory land and waterbirds. Over 800 species of birds are estimated to be found in Bhutan of which frequent numbers of winter visitors, such as migrant thrushes are found in addition to 450 species of resident birds (Sherpa2000). Forest is the most significant habitat for birds by supporting around 75% of all bird species while only 45% of all bird species have adapted to humans modified habitats (Birdlife International2008).Human activities such as farming, settlement, charcoal making, pole cutting and firewood collection have contributed in degradation which has extensively damaged the natural habitat of birds, affecting their variety and variability (Storch et al.2003).The threats to bird populations are immeasurable including habitat loss, fragmentation and severe anthropogenic pressures. Therefore the need to study the current composition and status of bird species as a basis for future monitoring and implementation of appropriate conservation measures (Choudhury 1991; Chandra andSingh2004).Birds constitute one of the common fauna of all habitat types, and because they are responsive to change, their diversity and abundance can reflect ecological trends in other biodiversity (Furness andGreenwood1993). MATERIALS AND METHODS Study Area Punatshangchhu (referred to as Sunkosh River in this paper) has a total length of about 320 kilometers from its source in Bhutan to its confluence point with Brahmaputra in India (Choden 2009). Therefore its river basin is one of the major river basins in Bhutan\n",

One day, while walking home from school, she stumbled upon an old, mysterious book hidden under a pile of trash. Curious, she opened it and found a map leading to a secret garden filled with magical flowers that could only be seen at midnight. Determined to explore, Lily ventured into the city's labyrinth, her heart full of excitement. When she reached the garden, she discovered a note addressed to her: \"Find the light within you.\" As she gazed at the glowing flowers, she realized the note was a reflection of her own soul. With newfound wisdom and courage, Lily returned home, her eyes wide with understanding. From that day on, she carried the lessons of the garden with her, guiding others through their own challenges. And so, the city thrived under the light of hearts that were both wise and kind.\n"
